# Theory
Every day the portfolio reshes based on the EMA ranking.Among the universe (e.g. SP500 stocks), it ranks by dialy (price - EMA) 
percentage as of trading time and keep positions in sync with lowes tranked stocks.

The idea is the low (price - EMA) vs price ration indicates there is a big dip in a short time. Since the universe is SP500 
which means there is some fundamental strengths, the belief is that the price should be recovered to some extent.

## How to run

First set up you rAPI key in environment variables.
```
$ export APCA_API_KEY_ID=xxx
$ export APCA_API_SCRET_KEY=yyy

```

The only depencey is the alpace-trade-api module. You can set up the environment by pipenv. IF python 3 and the dependency is ready,

```
$ python main.py
```

## Customization
universe.Universe is hard-code. Easy customization is to change this to a more dynamic set of stocks with some filters like per-share price
set to a minimum or maximum. The assumption is that at most a position can take is up 20% of the portfolio. If your account size varies or risk 
tolerance then changing the values is needed.

## For the future
btes.py runs a simple simulation. Maodle needs more easy visualization or integrated setup.
